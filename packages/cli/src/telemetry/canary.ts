/**
 * CLI binding for the canary registry.
 *
 * `@hyperframes/core` owns the decision (pure, browser-safe, caller supplies
 * everything). This file supplies the three things only the CLI knows: the
 * install's stable id, the env override, and whether we're on CI.
 *
 * Using one, from anywhere in the CLI / producer call path:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { isCanaryEnabled } from "../telemetry/canary.js";
 * if (isCanaryEnabled("de-parallel-router")) { ...ramped path... }
 * ```
 *
 * That is the whole API. Percentage lives in the registry, not at the call
 * site, so ramping is a one-line edit in a patch release and never touches
 * the feature's own code.
