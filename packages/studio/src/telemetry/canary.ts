// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Studio (browser) binding for the shared canary registry.
//
// `@hyperframes/core` owns the decision and is deliberately pure — the caller
// supplies the unit id, the override and the exclusion. This file supplies
// those three from the browser, mirroring `packages/cli/src/telemetry/canary.ts`
// for the CLI. The public API is deliberately identical on both surfaces:
//
//   import { isCanaryEnabled } from "../telemetry/canary";
//   if (isCanaryEnabled("my-feature")) { ... }
//
// so a call site reads the same whether it runs in Node or the browser, and a
// canary can span both.
//
// Three things differ from the CLI, each for a reason:
//
// 1. UNIT ID — the CLI's bucket seed (`window.__HF_CLI_BUCKET_SEED`) when the
//    CLI launched Studio, so both surfaces bucket on the SAME unit and a
//    rollout spanning render and editor is coherent for that user. Standalone
//    Studio falls back to `resolveStudioDistinctId()` — the browser has no
//    second storage location, so its localStorage id doubles as the seed.
//
// 2. OVERRIDE — there is no `process.env` in a page, so the override is a URL
//    query param mirrored into sessionStorage (see `readOverride`).
//
// 3. EXCLUSION — `navigator.webdriver` stands in for the CLI's `is_ci`.
//    Automated browsers mint a fresh localStorage id per run, so their ids are
//    ephemeral and they would hop cohorts between runs — noise in the rollout
//    signal, and nothing learned about real users.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Deep subpath imports, NOT the "@hyperframes/core" barrel. Studio is a
// browser bundle, and the barrel re-exports the whole core surface (parsers,
// lint, studio-server); pulling that in here drags a Node-oriented dependency
// graph into the bundle. These two modules are pure and leaf.
